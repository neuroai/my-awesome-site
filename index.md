# Sun Lab

## NeuroAI Lab @ Cornell

The Sun lab is interested in both biological and artificial intelligence, with the objective of achieving two complementary goals: 
1. To better understand the biological underpinnings of animal cognition and intelligent behavior.
2. To use this understanding to improve AI systems.

## Research

Current work includes employing large-scale 2-photon calcium imaging to study the neural basis of learning and cognitive map formation in rodents. In parallel, the lab uses the insights learned from these neuroscience experiments to inspire the development of novel AI algorithms that can reason using naturally formed internal world models, bridging the gap between biological and artificial intelligence.

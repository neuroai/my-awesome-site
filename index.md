# Sun Lab

## NeuroAI Lab @ Cornell

The Sun lab is interested in both biological and artificial intelligence, with the objective of achieving two complementary goals: 
1. To better understand the biological underpinnings of animal cognition and intelligent behavior.
2. To use this understanding to improve AI systems.
